# Darknet automotive #
Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation.

Darknet automotive is darknet specialized in autonomous driving machine larning algorithms. The idea is to provide machine learning models for autonomous driving, training environments, testing simulations, fast and lightweight code, and everything built on top of darknet.

# OIS dataset #
OIS (Objects in Street) is a dataset built for traffic signs detection. I know, the name is dope.
